## Component Details

### WhatsApp Integration

JobTrackAI uses the WhatsApp Business API to send and receive messages. Users interact with the system through a WhatsApp chat interface, sending natural language messages about their job applications.

**Key Features:**
- Webhook-based message reception
- Message delivery to users
- Support for text-based interactions

### Make.com Scenarios

Make.com (formerly Integromat) serves as the integration layer between WhatsApp and the FastAPI backend. Two main scenarios handle the workflow:

#### 1. New User Scenario (`new_user.json`)

This scenario handles:
- Incoming WhatsApp webhook events
- User lookup in Supabase database
- New user registration if the user doesn't exist
- Message forwarding to the FastAPI backend
- Welcome message for new users

**Flow:**
1. WhatsApp webhook event triggers the scenario
2. Scenario checks if the user exists in Supabase
3. If not, creates a new user record and sends a welcome message
4. If user exists, sets variables (user_id, message) and forwards to the bot scenario
5. Variables are passed to the FastAPI backend for processing

#### 2. Bot Interaction Scenario (`bot.json`)

This scenario handles:
- Processing responses from the FastAPI backend
- Sending messages back to the user via WhatsApp

**Flow:**
1. Receives message content, user ID, and WhatsApp ID as parameters
2. Sends HTTP request to the FastAPI backend with user message and ID
3. Processes the response from the API
4. Directly sends the agent's response back to the user via WhatsApp using the WhatsApp Business Cloud API
5. Uses the user's WhatsApp ID to ensure the message is delivered to the correct recipient

### FastAPI Backend

The backend is built with FastAPI and provides the core business logic, AI processing, and database interactions.

**Key Components:**

1. **Main Application (`main.py`)**
   - FastAPI setup and configuration
   - RESTful API endpoints for job management
   - Service initialization
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **Models**
   - `agent.py`: Defines UserMessage, AgentResponse models, and IntentType enum
   - `job.py`: Defines Job-related models including JobStatus enum

3. **Optimized Services**
   - `agent_service.py`: **OPTIMIZED** - Hybrid AI logic with rule-based preprocessing and intelligent AI fallback
   - `openai_service.py`: **OPTIMIZED** - Consolidated API calls, smart prompt engineering, safety detection
   - `supabase_service.py`: Database interactions with fallback connection handling

**🚀 Optimization Highlights:**
- **Hybrid Intent Classification**: Simple rules for obvious cases (99% confidence), AI for nuanced understanding
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple company updates in single messages ("rejected from Tesla and xAI")
- **Dynamic Entity Extraction**: AI-powered extraction of companies and statuses from natural language
- **Smart Job Matching**: Intelligent matching when multiple jobs exist at same company
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Emotional intelligence based on job status (encouragement, celebration, etc.)

### OpenAI Integration ⚡ **OPTIMIZED**

The system uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini with **dramatically reduced token consumption**:

**Core AI Functions:**
- **Intent Classification**: Context-aware understanding without hardcoded keywords
- **Entity Extraction**: Dynamic company/job extraction from natural language
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple operations in single API calls
- **Safety Detection**: Built-in ethical guardrails
- **Response Generation**: Emotionally intelligent, context-aware responses

**🔥 Optimization Techniques:**
- **Consolidated API Calls**: Combine intent detection, extraction, and response generation
- **Smart Prompting**: Highly efficient prompts with clear instructions and examples
- **JSON Response Format**: Structured outputs for reliable parsing
- **Context Caching**: Conversation history for smarter responses
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation when AI calls fail

**Key Response Generators:**
- `generate_helpful_response`: Intelligent responses focused on tracker operations only
- `generate_friendly_job_list`: Enhanced job listings with status text + emojis
- Safety-filtered responses preventing career advice and off-topic discussions

### Supabase Database

Supabase provides the database layer with PostgreSQL and additional features:

**Key Tables:**
- `users`: Stores user information
- `jobs`: Stores job application details
- `conversations`: Stores conversation history and metadata

**Connection Methods:**
- REST API for most operations
- Transaction pooler for database connections (aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543)

## Data Flow

### End-to-End Message Flow

1. **User Sends Message (WhatsApp):**
   - User sends a text message via WhatsApp
   - Example: "I applied for Software Engineer at Google yesterday"

2. **WhatsApp to Make.com:**
   - WhatsApp Business API sends a webhook event to Make.com
   - Make.com processes the incoming webhook payload

3. **Make.com to Supabase (User Check):**
   - Make.com checks if the WhatsApp number exists in the users table
   - If not, creates a new user record

4. **Make.com to FastAPI:**
   - Make.com forwards the message to the FastAPI backend
   - Endpoint: POST /agent/message
   - Payload: { "user_id": "user123", "message": "I applied for Software Engineer at Google yesterday" }

5. **FastAPI Processing:**
   - `AgentService.process_message()` receives the request
   - OpenAI service detects intent (job creation)
   - OpenAI service extracts entities (job title, company, status, date)
   - Supabase service creates a new job record
   - OpenAI service generates a friendly response

6. **FastAPI to Make.com:**
   - FastAPI returns the response to Make.com
   - Response includes the message text and any actions taken

7. **Make.com to WhatsApp:**
   - Make.com forwards the response to WhatsApp
   - User receives the friendly, personalized response

## Key Processes

### New User Registration

When a new user messages the system for the first time:

1. Make.com receives the WhatsApp webhook event
2. Make.com checks if the phone number exists in Supabase
3. If not, Make.com creates a new user record with:
   - WhatsApp phone number as identifier
   - Default settings
   - Creation timestamp
4. The user is now registered and can interact with the system

### Message Processing ⚡ **OPTIMIZED HYBRID APPROACH**

The optimized message processing uses a **hybrid AI system**:

1. **Fast Rule-Based Preprocessing** (`_classify_intent_simple()`):
   - Handles ultra-obvious cases instantly (99% confidence)
   - Example: "show my jobs" → `JOB_SEARCH` (zero API calls)
   - Covers ~20% of requests with zero latency

2. **AI-Powered Classification** (`_classify_with_ai()`):
   - Context-aware intent understanding for complex cases
   - No hardcoded keyword matching - pure natural language understanding
   - Handles nuanced requests like "That Tesla gig didn't work out"

3. **Intent-Specific Processing**:
   - `NEW_JOB`: Smart job creation with entity extraction
   - `STATUS_UPDATE`: **Batch processing** for multiple companies
   - `JOB_SEARCH`: Enhanced listings with status text + emojis  
   - `JOB_DELETE`: Intelligent job removal from tracker
   - `UNKNOWN`: Focused clarification without advice-giving

4. **Smart Entity Extraction**:
   - AI extracts companies, job titles, and statuses dynamically
   - Batch operations: "rejected from Tesla and xAI" updates both
   - Context-aware matching when multiple jobs exist

5. **Conversation Context**: Maintains history for smarter multi-turn interactions

### Job Creation

When a user wants to add a new job application:

1. System detects "job creation" intent
2. OpenAI extracts job details:
   - Job title
   - Company name
   - Application date
   - Initial status (default: applied)
   - Any notes or additional information

3. System creates a job record in Supabase
4. System generates a friendly confirmation using `generate_friendly_job_created()`
5. If information is missing, system asks for clarification

### Job Status Updates ⚡ **OPTIMIZED BATCH PROCESSING**

The optimized status update system handles **multiple jobs simultaneously**:

1. **AI-Powered Status & Company Extraction**:
   - Extracts ALL companies mentioned in single message
   - Example: "got rejected from Tesla and xAI" → extracts both companies
   - Dynamic status detection from context (rejected, interview, offer, withdrawn)

2. **Smart Job Matching**:
   - Handles multiple jobs at same company intelligently
   - Uses job title keywords for disambiguation
   - Example: "Full Stack job at Meta" matches "Full Stack Developer" position

3. **Batch Database Updates**:
   - Updates multiple job records in single operation
   - Maintains data consistency across batch operations
   - Optimized database queries

4. **Intelligent Response Generation**:
   - Single job: "Updated Software Engineer at Google to rejected! Keep your head up 💪"
   - Multiple jobs: "Updated 2 applications at Tesla, xAI to rejected! Keep your head up 💪"
   - Context-aware encouragement based on status type

5. **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation to simple keyword matching if AI extraction fails

### Job Listing ⚡ **ENHANCED DISPLAY**

The optimized job listing provides rich, user-friendly displays:

1. **Enhanced Status Display**:
   - Shows both status text AND emoji for clarity
   - Example: "applied 📝", "rejected ❌", "interview 🎯", "offer 🎉"
   - User feedback: "show job status too" ✅ implemented

2. **Smart Formatting**:
   - Clean, scannable job list format
   - Organized by relevance and recency
   - Contextual information display

3. **Encouraging Responses**:
   - "Here are your X applications:" with motivational messaging
   - Status-aware encouragement ("Keep pushing forward! ✨")
   - Personalized tone matching user's situation

4. **Fast Retrieval**: Optimized database queries with appropriate filtering and sorting

## Deployment Architecture

JobTrackAI is deployed on Railway with the following configuration:

- **Web Service**: FastAPI application
- **Database**: Connection to Supabase via transaction pooler
- **Environment Variables**: Configured in Railway dashboard
- **Dockerfile**: Defines the container setup

**Key Deployment Considerations:**
- Railway environment must have correct Supabase connection details
- Transaction pooler is used for database connections (aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543)
- Environment variables must include OpenAI API keys

## Environment Configuration

The following environment variables are required:

```
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.user:password@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

# Application Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
PORT=8000
HOST=0.0.0.0
```

**Important Notes:**
- `SUPABASE_URL` must be the REST API URL (https://your-project.supabase.co)
- `DATABASE_URL` must use the transaction pooler (aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543)
- Local development can use direct Postgres connection, but production should use the transaction pooler
