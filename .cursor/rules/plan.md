# JobTrackAI Development Plan

## Project Setup Phase
- [x] Initialize uv project
- [x] Set up virtual environment
- [x] Install core dependencies (FastAPI, OpenAI, Supabase, etc.)
- [x] Generate requirements.txt from current environment
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [x] Set up .env.example file
- [x] Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore

## Core Infrastructure
- [x] Create FastAPI application structure
- [x] Set up Supabase connection and configuration
- [x] Implement database models and schema
- [x] Create Pydantic models for data validation
- [x] Set up logging configuration

## AI Agent Implementation
- [x] Configure OpenAI client and API integration
- [x] Implement intent classification system
- [x] Create entity recognition for job details
- [x] Build agent message processing pipeline
- [x] Implement context handling and memory (Supabase-backed conversations/messages)
- [x] Auto-extract job details (title, company, link) and infer status from message
- [x] Auto-create job entries when required fields are present (minimal clarifications)
- [x] Link parsing with lightweight page title fallback
- [x] LLM-crafted tone: supportive/cheerful for positive events; compassionate for negative
- [x] Small-talk detection and gentle redirect via OpenAI
- [x] Safety guardrails (OpenAI + keywords) with kind refusal responses



## API Endpoints
- [x] Create `/agent/message` endpoint
- [x] Implement job CRUD operations
- [x] Add status update functionality
- [x] Create job search and filtering
- [x] Implement ambiguity resolution prompts
  - Notes: Prompts now only ask for truly missing required fields; status defaults to `applied` when user says "applied" or shares a link.

## Integrations
- [ ] WhatsApp via Make.com (Make handles user creation; backend consumes `/agent/message`)

## Database Operations
- [x] Set up Supabase tables and relationships
- [x] Implement job insertion logic
- [x] Create status update queries
- [x] Add job search and filtering queries
- [x] Implement data validation and sanitization

## Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Set up structured logging with structlog
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add request/response logging
- [ ] Create error monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation

## Testing
- [ ] Set up pytest configuration
- [ ] Create unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Implement integration tests for Supabase
- [ ] Add API endpoint tests
- [ ] Mock OpenAI API calls for testing

## Security & Performance
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add rate limiting for OpenAI API
- [ ] Set up connection pooling for database
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Add security headers and CORS configuration

## Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation with FastAPI
- [ ] Write setup and installation guide
- [ ] Document environment variables
- [ ] Create deployment instructions
- [x] Update README.md with project details

## Deployment Preparation
- [x] Create Docker configuration
- [ ] Set up environment-specific configs
- [ ] Implement health checks
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- [ ] WhatsApp integration (advanced features: media, templates, rate limiting)
- [ ] Resume ATS matching
- [ ] Company research summaries
- [ ] Multi-user authentication
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard

## Current Status
**Phase**: Core Infrastructure & AI Agent Implementation
**Next Priority**: Set up Supabase database table and test full integration
**Blockers**: None identified
**Estimated MVP Completion**: 1-2 weeks

## Recent Updates
- ✅ Fixed agent service to use proper intent classification
- ✅ Created env.example file for environment setup
- ✅ Agent is now testable without database integration
- ✅ Implemented rule-based intent classification (working perfectly!)
- ✅ Fixed job link handling with graceful fallback
- ✅ Integrated Supabase service with FastAPI endpoints
- ✅ Implemented full CRUD operations for jobs
- ✅ Added job statistics endpoint
- ✅ All API endpoints are now functional
- ✅ All test cases now pass with proper intent recognition
- ✅ AI now auto-extracts job_title/company/status from messages and links
- ✅ Minimal clarifications: only asks for missing required fields
- ✅ Default status inference: infers `applied` when user says "applied" or provides a job link
- ✅ LLM-driven small-talk redirects and safety refusals
- ✅ Outcome-aware confirmations via OpenAI (no hardcoded phrasing)
- ✅ WhatsApp Make.com webhook added with phone-based user provisioning
- ✅ Added `users` table and DB helpers (lookup/create)
