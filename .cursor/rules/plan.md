# JobTrackAI Development Plan

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Railway Deployment Fix (2025-01-12)
- [x] **Fixed ModuleNotFoundError for `app.models`** - FINAL SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
  - Root cause: Python import path resolution issue with `uv run` in Docker containers
  - **Solution 1**: Converted all relative imports to absolute imports (`from app.models.agent import...`)
  - **Solution 2**: Fixed Dockerfile to properly handle `uv` virtual environment with `PYTHONPATH=/app`
  - Added `.dockerignore` to exclude development files from container build
  - **VERIFIED**: Docker container builds and runs successfully, imports work correctly
- [x] **Updated deployment configuration to use `uv`**
  - Updated Dockerfile to use `uv sync` for dependency management
  - Modified railway.toml to use `uv run` command 
  - Tested Docker build and container execution successfully
- [x] **Updated documentation**
  - Added troubleshooting section to README.md with fix details
  - Documented prevention measures for future deployment issues
  - Created comprehensive development plan

## üîÑ Current Status
- ‚úÖ Application successfully runs locally with `uv`
- ‚úÖ All imports working correctly (absolute imports implemented)  
- ‚úÖ Docker container builds and runs without import errors
- ‚úÖ Ready for Railway deployment with verified configuration
